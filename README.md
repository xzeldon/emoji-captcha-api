### A CAPTCHA implementation based on identifying emojis

This was exclusively developed to be used in Telegram, but might be used
anywhere else.

## Brief Description

1. The client sends an HTTP request to the server.

2. The server returns a generated photo that has 6 emojis inside it, along with:

   - A custom header called `x-emojis` that includes the code points of the six
     emojis in the photo plus 2 random ones in hex, shuffled, splitted by ";",
     and the parts of each of them splitted by "-".

   - A custom header called `x-correct-emojis` that only includes the code
     points of the 6 emojis in the photo.

3. The client displays the photo returned by the server, along with the emojis
   provided in the `x-emojis` in a way the user can pick them.

4. The client compares the first six emojis that the user picked with
   `x-correct-emojis`.
